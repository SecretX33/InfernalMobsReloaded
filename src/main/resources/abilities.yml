# Archer ability
# Shoots a volley of arrows on the target and nearby entities
archer:
  projectile-speed: 2.2        # honestly, this speed is in vector, so you can think in it like m/s or something
  arrow-amount: 8-15           # how many arrows are going to be shot, in default configuration it is 8-15
  arrow-delay: 0.2             # in seconds, the delay between each arrow launch
  recheck-delay: 1.0           # in seconds, every 1 second it'll run the random chance to see if it's going to spawn shoot the arrows
  chance: 0.04                 # in percentage, every 'reckeck-delay' seconds, the power will have 5% chance of being triggered

# Armoured ability
# Makes the entity spawn with a beefy armor, or a damage reduction effect if it cannot wear armor
armoured:
  armor-drop-chance: 0.001     # armoured mobs will have 0.1% chance of dropping one of its special armor pieces or weapon
  fallback-dmg-resist-potion-level: 1    # When the mob cannot wear armor, it'll instead gain the Resistance effect, and each level gives it + 20% damage reduction; level 1 will provide 20% damage reduction

# Berserk ability
# The entity inflict more damage, but also receive more damage
berserk:

# Bliding ability
# Each of its attacks may cause blindness on whoever is unlucky enough to be fighting against it
